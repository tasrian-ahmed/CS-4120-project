# Dataset Instructions

This project uses the **Medical Cost Personal Dataset**, available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance?resource=download

## Steps to prepare:
1. Download `insurance.csv` from the Kaggle link above.
2. Place the file in this `data/` directory (e.g., `data/insurance.csv`).
3. Do NOT commit the dataset to GitHub â€” `.gitignore` ensures raw data is excluded.
